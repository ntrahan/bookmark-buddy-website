				Ever since I switched to Chrome as my primary browser many years ago, I'd been missing the ability to
				view my bookmarks in a sidebar. Since literally every other desktop browser ever made had one, I was
				sure Google would eventually follow suit and add this basic feature to their own browser, but alas, that
				day never came. I looked for extensions, but all the so-called sidebars out there actually hovered over
				the page you were looking at. "That's not a real sidebar!", I would cry out (in my head). It seemed I
				would have to take matters into my own hands if I wanted things to change, and so I set out on a mission
				to create a real sidebar for Chrome. After an embarrassingly large amount of time, I think I got pretty
				close, and Bookmark Buddy was born. Hope you enjoy.<br />-<a href="https://twitter.com/NicolasTrahan"

				The Bookmark Buddy icon and banner were designed by Rachel Henwood: her email is "Rhenwood", followed by
				the at symbol, followed by "live.ca".
